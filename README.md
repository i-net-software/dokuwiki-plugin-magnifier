Image Magnifier
===============

This is a []DokuWiki plugin](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:magnifier) that renders a loupe over a smaller sized image. Inside the loupe will be the full image that can be revealed by hovering over the parts.

_Note:_ The image of the loupe cannot be changed at the moment since the script requires its current dimensions and positions.

This plugin also works fine together with the [popupviewer](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:popupviewer) plugin

Syntax
------

The syntax is synonymous to the image syntax.

```
{{magnifier>%IMAGE%|%TITLE}}
```

  * __%IMAGE%__ - is the usual image syntax including sizing specifiers
  * __%TITLE%__ - a title for the image.
